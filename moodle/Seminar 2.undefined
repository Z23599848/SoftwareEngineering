<h2 id="group-tasks-today">Group Tasks Today</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Gather your group together</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Decide who will be your Scrum master today</strong> (ie. faciltates meeting).  Try to rotate this role for each meeting.</li>
  <li><strong>Decide who will be taking notes today</strong>  The note taker should open the meeting minutes template in word and fill it in as the meeting progresses</li>
  <li><strong>Draft your code of conduct</strong>.  Consider what is important to you and what will keep your project on track.  Use the Mozilla code of conduct as a starting point: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/" title="Mozilla code of conduct">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/</a>. Talk each point through and decide if it is useful to include in your code of conduct.  Decide what additional points you should add that are important in our specific context.</li>
</ol>

<p>You will need to additionally define rules around:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>*  Frequency of meetings - you should aim for a short meeting at least 3 times per week. These can be online. Short 'standup' meetings are fine where the group members check in with their activities.
*  Gathering work in time for deadlines
*  Participation expectations: what do do if a team member does not particpate
*  Participation expectations: Attending lab sessions
</code></pre></div></div>

<ol>
  <li>Talk about your team name and the topic you want to work on</li>
  <li>Review the sprint 1 tasks and decide on the steps you need to take to fulfill them.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>At the end of each meeting the note taker should summarise the main points discussed, the action points going forward and confirm the date, time and place of the next meeting</strong></p>
