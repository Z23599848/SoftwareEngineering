## Team Code of Conduct

To support a productive and respectful working environment, our team agrees to follow the principles outlined below. These guidelines define how we interact, collaborate, and manage our responsibilities throughout the project.

### Communication Standards

* Communicate clearly, respectfully, and professionally with all team members.
* Ensure that everyone has the chance to share ideas, raise concerns, and give feedback.
* Reply to messages and emails from teammates within a 00 reasonable timeframe.

### Teamwork and Collaboration

* Contribute fairly to group work and support one another in completing tasks.
* Take responsibility for individual duties while holding each other accountable as a team.
* Show flexibility and understanding toward the different commitments and circumstances of team members.

### Compliance with Rules and Policies

* Follow all project-related rules and expectations outlined in this document and 00 elsewhere.
* Act in accordance with University policies and academic regulations at all times.

### Scrum Practices

**1. Sprint Planning:**
At the beginning of each week, the team will meet to decide which tasks will be completed during the sprint. Tasks will be estimated using story points. The Scrum Master role will rotate every two weeks.

**2. Sprint Review:**
At the end of each sprint, the team will review completed work, gather feedback, and identify improvements for upcoming sprints.

**3. Defined Roles and Responsibilities:**

* **Scrum Master**

  * Coordinate and guide the Scrum process.
  * Regularly check progress and address any obstacles faced by the team.
  * Ensure agreed workflows and timelines are followed.

* **Project Owner**

  * Manage and prioritize the project backlog.
  * Communicate the project vision and objectives clearly to the team.
  * Evaluate completed work and request changes if required.

**4. Daily Stand-ups:**
The Scrum Master will conduct Weekly meeting at library. These updates will focus on completed work, current challenges, and any assistance required, while remaining flexible to students’ schedules.

### Managing Non-Compliance

* If a team member is unable to attend a meeting or lab, they will receive a summary of what was covered. Continued absence without prior communication may be reported to the module tutor.
* Ongoing failure to complete assigned tasks or repeated actions that delay team progress will be discussed as a group, and appropriate steps will be taken to resolve the issue.

By following this code of conduct, we aim to create a respectful, inclusive, and efficient working environment where every team member feels supported and valued.

Attendance, Availability & Exceptional Circumstances

All team members are expected to attend scheduled lectures, labs, sprint reviews, and group presentations, particularly those that contribute to assessed coursework. Attendance is considered a shared responsibility, as the absence of a single member may negatively impact the group’s overall mark.

We recognise that exceptional or emergency situations may occur. In such cases:

The affected team member must inform the group as early as possible, preferably at least 24 hours in advance where feasible.

Notification should be made via the agreed communication channel (e.g. Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp, or 00 GitHub).

A brief explanation should be provided to allow the team to adapt plans accordingly.

Last-minute notifications should only occur in genuine emergencies.

If a team member is unable to attend a critical assessed activity (e.g. presentation or sprint review):

Responsibilities will be reallocated to ensure continuity.

Supporting materials (slides, scripts, notes) must be shared in advance where possible.

Another team member may be required to temporarily cover the missing role.

Repeated absence without valid justification may result in:

Reallocation of tasks,

Reduced responsibility in future sprints,

Documentation of the issue in meeting records and task boards,

Escalation to the module tutor if necessary.
