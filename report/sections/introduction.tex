\section{Introduction}

StudyBuddy is a web-based collaborative platform designed to support university students in organising study activities, connecting with peers, and improving academic collaboration and wellbeing.

The system enables students to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Create personal profiles containing course, year, and module information.
    \item Search for study partners based on module and availability.
    \item Send and manage study session requests.
    \item Provide ratings and feedback.
    \item Report or block inappropriate users.
\end{itemize}

The project is developed using Agile Scrum methodology and integrates ethical, security, and accessibility considerations throughout its lifecycle.
