\section{Scrum Practices}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Sprint Planning:} Every timetabled lesson or whenever it is requested by a group member, the team will meet to decide which tasks will be completed during the sprint. Tasks will be designated by the Scrum Master or chosen by group members.
    \item \textbf{Sprint Review:} At the end of each sprint, the team will review completed work, gather feedback, and identify improvements for upcoming sprints.
    \item \textbf{Daily Stand-ups:} The Scrum Master can conduct weekly meetings at the library or via Microsoft Teams. These meetings focus on completed work, current challenges, and to see if any assistance is required from a team member, while remaining flexible to students’ schedules.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Defined Roles and Responsibilities}
\textbf{Scrum Master:} Coordinate and guide the Scrum process. Regularly check progress and address any obstacles faced by the team. Ensure agreed workflows and timelines are followed.

\textbf{Project Owner:} Manage and prioritize the project backlog. Communicate the project vision and objectives clearly to the team. Evaluate completed work and request changes if required.
