## 1. Project Description
Study buddies is a group software engineering project designed to support university students in organising their study activities, connecting with peers, and improving collaboration and wellbeing. Users can create an account in order to find other people to study or chat with based on a variety of categories, such as the type of course a user is studying or what kind of person they would like to study with. Users can send chat requests to study together, search for people via different filtering categories, and provide ratings for people they have studied with.
